Being the youngest sibling, I was spoiled by having all the tech toys like PC, Mobiles, Consoles etc. around me which resulted in me catching and growing interest in Computer Science as I aged.</td>

It is counted among the small cities situated in the southest of the province Punjab. There is a desert nearby which we never hesitate going to such that we've always considered it more of a park than a desert. Pakistan is known worldwide for its diversity in every regard whether it is types of folks you find there or the variety of food.</td>

All I can say is that any song that I can either vibe with and/or relate to its lyrics, becomes my jam. 'Ankhein Teri Kitni Haseen' by Roop Kumar Rathod and 'Tera Mera Rishta Purana' by Mustafa Zahid are two among the top ones </td>

I am taking Bachelor of Computer Science and this is my first year, first semester in degree. I chose Computer Science because I found solving problems very rewarding in the end. I noticed my enjoyment for problem-solving stems from my secondary years where I took Computer Science and learned QBasic64 at that time.

                My hometown is Bau, Sarawak; It is around 30km from Kuching. Bau used to be a mining town however, recently it became more of a tourist attraction for the Kuching area. This is due to its natural geological features such as Tasik Biru, The Fairy Cave, the limestone formation and the overall scenery of small mountains surrounding the area.

After going inside, she realizes that there is more to this place than meets the eye, as strange things begin to happen once dusk falls. Ghostly sprites and food that turns her parents into pigs are just the startâ€”Chihiro has unwittingly crossed over into the spirit world. Now trapped, she must summon the courage to live and work among spirits...</td>

                <td class="Adils-content">Since I've never lived in Sri Lanka, Dubai is where I consider home. Dubai is a city full of buildings. 
				The summers are typically very hot, reaching 50 degrees Celsius, but once you begin to adjust to it, it's actually not that bad. 
				Furthermore, air conditioners are found everywhere. There, you will meet incredibly kind, polite, and helpful people. 
				It's a thriving community since there are individuals from all over the world, not only Arabs.</td>

				captivates readers with its deeply felt examination of philosophical, love, and grief. 
				The Author Murakami crafts a hauntingly beautiful story that stays in the mind long after reading thanks to his lyrical style and rich character development.</td>

				and intriguing discussion about reality and perception, "Inception" attracts audiences. Through his excellent directing, 
				The director Christopher Nolan creates a cinematic experience that is unlike anything else.</td>
